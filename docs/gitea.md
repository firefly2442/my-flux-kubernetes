# Gitea

Gitea is a self-hosted Git repo platform similar to Github or Gitlab.

Gitea is [working through](https://gitea.com/gitea/helm-gitea/issues/903) the
[Bitnami reorganization and movement to private registries](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/83267).

Another potential option is Forgejo which is a fork.

Integration with Authentik using OAuth2 and SSO is setup for easy login.
